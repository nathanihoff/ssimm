**Overview**: Do Americans view lesbian and gay (LG) migrants as more deserving to enter the country than their straight counterparts? This question has yet to be evaluated, but is important to address for two reasons. First, recent changes in federal policy have contributed toward significant increases in LG migrants coming to the U.S. [@hoffmann_2021_making; @vogler_2016]. Despite these growths, how Americans view these types of migrant is unknown. Second, while Americans are increasingly polarized on their views toward migration, support for gay and lesbian migrants may be cross-cutting. Strong majorities now support related issues like marriage equality and even the Trump Administration discursively promoted pro-gay elements in U.S. foreign policy -- enhancing the image of the U.S. as a tolerant society even during rising ethnonationalism that inhibit migrants, generally. Therefore, this project proposes to investigate whether sexual minorities are evaluated as more deserving due to perceived cultural similarity to the U.S. The goal of the proposed study is to disentangle Americans' preferences for migrants' presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit using sexual minority migrants as a case study.  

<!-- According to American Community Survey data, numbers of different-sex couples including immigrants increased by 22 percent from 2013 to 2019 (from 7.8 million to 9.5 million), while those of corresponding same-sex couples grew from 44 thousand to 107 thousand in the same period, an increase of 140 percent.  -->


**Background**: Two recent policy changes have contributed to a rapid rise of lesbian and gay immigrants in the United States. In 2011, President Obama moved to make queer refugees a "population of concern" for the U.S. [@vogler_2016]; boosting the number of successful claims [@shaw_2021_lgbt]. Then, in 2013, U.S. citizens were allowed to sponsor the visa of a same-sex partner for the first time after the Defense of Marriage Act ended [@edwards_2013]. Since, numbers of same-sex couples including immigrants increased 140 percent -- a dramatic increase compared to the 22 percent for their heterosexual counterparts [@hoffmann_2021_making]. While most scholarship on LG immigrants focuses on cases of asylum-seekers fleeing repression [@murray_2014_real; @sam_2015_teacher; @akin_2017_queer; @dhoest_2019_learning; @giametta_2020_new; @saleh_2020_queer], recent work suggests that the typical LG immigrant may be privileged and coming from progressive contexts [@hoffmann_2021_making; @hoffmann_2022_policy]. These observations raise our key research questions: to what extent do Americans leverage sexual orientation as a salient factor to determine the deservingness of potential LG immigrants? Does economic potential or humanitarian merit condition these effects?

Previous experimental work has attempted to assess how native-born respondents assess the "deservingness" of migrants to gain legal entry to their country. This work broadly supports three theories of deservingness: *cultural similarity*, *economic potential*, and *humanitarian merit*.

<!--  Do they see refugees persecuted for their sexuality as more deserving of entry than privileged, high-earning LGB immigrants? When considering who should migrate to the United States, how do Americans evaluate sexuality as compared to earnings potential or credible danger? -->    

We argue *cultural similarity* will be the primary mechanism through which Americans determine LG immigrant deservingness. While theories of *cultural similarity* are evaluated less frequently, existing research finds biases against Muslims and non-English speakers while Christians and English speakers are viewed as more deserving [@bansak_2016_how; @donnaloja_2022_british]. This work supports "norms-based," "sociotropic" explanations [@hainmueller_2015_hidden]. And one such norm in development is that the U.S. is welcoming of lesbian and gay individuals -- at least in international imagery [@snow_2020_routledge]. Even Western right-wing parties often promote gay-friendly foreign images if only to justify opposition to Black and Brown immigrants due to their assumed homophobic attitudes or to justify foreign intervention like foreign aid conditionalities (e.g., homonationalism) [@puar_2007_terrorist; @kwon_2022_multidimensional]. Thus, just like language or religion signals cultural closeness, so too will a gay or lesbian sexual orientation.

But theories of *economic potential* have greatest empirical support. Numerous studies find that highly educated migrants working in prestigious, high-earning professions are seen as most deserving of entry [@hainmueller_2010_attitudes; @helbling_2014_why; @hainmueller_2015_hidden; @donnaloja_2022_british]. Although economic potential is not a legal consideration when awarding refugee status, respondents find hypothetical refugees with economic potential to be more deserving [@bansak_2016_how; @lawlor_2021_deservingness].  

Additionally, work on refugees has pointed to the importance of *humanitarian merit* in matters of deservingness. While @bansak_2016_how find greater support in Europe for immigrants with greater economic potential, they also find that respondents favor immigrants coming for "humanitarian" rather than "economic" reasons. In the Danish context, @hedegaard_2022_attitudes finds that respondents are less likely to support climate migrants than typical refugees, but these two groups are both considered more deserving than economic migrants. 

<!--- In Japan, @fraser_2022_role find that immigrants fleeing natural disaster are seen as more deserving than those migrating due to political protest, labor shortage, or civil war.  --->

It is therefore important to disentangle cultural theories of immigrant deservingness from economic or humanitarian explanations. Doing so has yet to be convincingly executed. Part of the issue is that many of these aspects of countries and individuals are correlated. Immigrants originating in wealthier countries tend to be considered to have both more economic potential and cultural similarity. Humanitarian migrants usually originate in less wealthy countries that are regarded as having less cultural similarity or economic potential. And besides religion, few studies have assessed cultural similarity theory.  

We propose using a conjoint survey experiment to isolate these components of deservingness. Despite the recent rise of LG immigrants in the U.S., sexuality has been under-explored in studies of immigrant deservingness.^[@lawlor_2021_deservingness include persecution due to sexual orientation (along with religion) as a “humanitarian deservingness cues” for hypothetical asylum seeker profiles, but not for refugee profiles, and they do not disaggregate these two cues. @hedegaard_2022_attitudes list "sexuality" as a possible form of persecution for hypothetical refugee profiles, along with race, religion, nationality, or political orientation.] We will use sexual minority status as a measure of cultural similarity that overcomes these issues. Sexual minorities are present throughout the world, avoiding issues of country-level correlates. The present era is characterized by rapidly changing policies and attitudes regarding sexual minorities, as well as substantial global heterogeneity. A large majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage and other rights for same-sex couples [@ofosu_2019_same]. The proposed study will be one of the first survey experiments to consider immigrant sexuality explicitly.

**Research Design**: We will use a conjoint survey experiment, which allows isolation of these components [@hainmueller_2014_causal]. Respondents will read two vignettes describing hypothetical immigrants and choose the one they prefer to gain entry to the United States [@lawlor_2021_deservingness; @fraser_2022_role]. They will also give a numerical rating (between 1 and 7) of each profile's deservingness, perceived sharing of American values, and have space to justify their decisions with open-ended text. Respondents will all be U.S. citizens, and they will be asked whether they identify as a sexual or gender minority.   

For the immigrant profiles, we will vary four attributes. Two are controls: gender has two levels (man and woman) and country GDP has three levels (wealthy, middle-income, and poor). The other two attributes test our hypotheses: Skill has three levels (has an MD and works as a cardiologist; has a high school degree and works as a restaurant manager; and has a primary school education and works in custodial), and reason for migration has five levels (identifies as gay, left because homosexuality is criminalized; identifies as gay, left because spoken out against authoritarian government; identifies as gay, could not find work; identifies as straight, spoken out against authoritarian government; identifies as straight, could not find work). In all, this creates $2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 90$ potential profiles for respondents to evaluate.  

We will present respondents with two vignettes, and they will indicate which one they see as more deserving of being admitted to the United States. One example profile might read: "Immigrant 1 wishes to be admitted as an immigrant to the U.S. She comes from a wealthy country, has a high school degree and works as a restaurant manager. She identifies as gay. She had to leave her country because she has spoken out against the authoritarian government and feared for her life." Further details about the survey instrument are in the Appendix.  

In addition to estimating average marginal component effects (AMCEs) for the attributes of interest [@hainmueller_2014_causal], we will test for the presence of heterogeneous effects for subsamples of respondents [@leeper_2020_measuring], including by political ideology, educational level, and sexual/gender identity.

**Pretest Results**: Our pilot study...  

**Contribution**: This study contributes to literature on immigrant deservingness and sexual minorities.
